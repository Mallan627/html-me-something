        <h1>My Titanic Adventure</h1>
        <h3>A trip to the <i>Titanic</i> museum in Branson, Missouri.</h3>
    </header>
<p>Back in December of 2009, my family and I went on a trip to Branson, MO.  Among other things we visited was the Titanic museum.  It was definitely one of the highlights of the trip!<p>
<p></p>
<p>The outside of the museum was made up to look like the actual Titanic (at least the front anyway) and they even had a little waterfall spraying up near what would have been the bow of the ship, making look as the ship plowed full steam ahead.</p>

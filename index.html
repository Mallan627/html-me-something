        <h3>A trip to the <i>Titanic</i> museum in Branson, Missouri.</h3>

    <section>
        <p>Back in December of 2009, my family and I went on a trip to Branson, MO.  Among other things we visited was the Titanic museum.  It was definitely one of the highlights of the trip!<p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The outside of the museum was made up to look like the actual Titanic (at least the front anyway) and they even had a little waterfall spraying up near the bow of the ship, making it look as if the ship was plowing full steam ahead through the ocean.</p>

<p>As part of the tour in the museum, you're given a replica boarding pass with the name of an actual passenger. The pass lists what class they were (first, second, or third) and gave the
    location of their cabin. At the end of the tour, there was a wall with a listing of all 2,000 plus passengers by crew and class, and you could look up your passenger to see whether or
    not "you" had survived the voyage. (Small hint, if you're a guy, odds weren't in your favor, doubly so if you were third class.)</p>
<br>
<p>As part of recreating the whole Titanic experience, the staff were dressed in authentic looking period era clothing the crew would have worn.  That was a nice touch, but they didn't go
    overboard with it. It's not like they couldn't "break character" or anything.</p>
<br>
<p>Right at the entrance, they had a wall made of plastic ice with a square section of REAL ice, so you could feel what an iceberg would have been like. (Hint, it's kind of like regular ice,
    only larger!) After the ice was a large replica model of the Titanic. The detail on that thing was amazing. You could see the tiny steering wheels, ladders on the smoke stacks, even details
    through the glass windows. </p>
    <br>
<p>I talked for several minutes with the guy who stood in that room, and he was very knowledgeable about all the details of the ship, and handled all of my, "Okay, what's this?" and "How about this?" questions rather well.
<br>
<p>The museum was full of photos and actual pieces of newspaper clippings, diaries, letters and various objects from the time. One display I remember in particular was about how even though the third class tickets were the
    cheapest, they were still better accommodations than many of the ships at the time (Titanic was, after all, a luxury cruise liner.) I smiled upon listening to a young actor reading from a diary entry of a third class
    passenger boy as he excitedly described his first day of the voyage, including the all the items of the terrific dinner he had. </p>
<br>
<p>Stopping by the gift shop, I picked up a few items, including a Magnet and this interesting paper weight here.</p>

<p>I've always been fascinated with these types of things.  The way that no matter how much you shake it, the blue and clear water will NOT mix.</p>
<p><h6><em>Neat fact: The blue water is actually dyed baby oil, which, as you can guess is thicker than water.<em></h6><p>

<p>All in all, it was an amazing experience!  If you're ever in the area, I highly recommend stopping by!</p>
